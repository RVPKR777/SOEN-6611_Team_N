# Post-Release Defect Density

The post-release Defect Density is a metric which we can compare across the different versions of the projects as well as various projects. The post-release Defect Density is basically used to indicate the Product Quality. The total number of source lines of code are used by the calculation of the post-release Defect Density. 

## Calculation :

Defect Density = Defect count/size of the release(SLOC)

•  Defect Count is the total number of post-release defects<br />
•  SLOC are the total number of  source lines of code

Here, there are 2 folders as follows.

**No of Defects :** This records the total number of defects that we have found for the each version of each project. There is one excel file for each project having the 6 sheets for each version in it.<br />
**Post Release Defect Density :** This folder contains the files of calculated Post-Release Defect Density value for the each project.<br />
