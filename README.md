# SOEN-6611_Team_NSOEN6611

Team projects will be in teams of 4~5 students. The project will empirically assess the correlations between metrics in test coverage metrics and software quality attributes. For this, students have to select a set of appropriate metrics based on the existing literature. The project requires data collection, data analysis. The final deliverables are the developed code, a maximum 8-page (2-column IEEE conference template) paper describing your observed study and findings, and the project presentation in class.

## Metrics

**Metric 1:** Statement Coverage

**Metric 2:** Branch Coverage

**Metric 3:** Mutation Score

**Metric 4:** McCabe Complexity Metric

**Metric 5:** Maintaninability Index

**Metric 6:** Post release defect density

## Data Collection Step

1. For code coverage we used eclipse plugin EclEmma which was pre-installed in Eclipse.
2. To collect data for code coverage follow these steps:
-> Right click on project and select option coverage as
-> Then select option Junit Eclipse and it will generate the full coverage and show in the coverage tab.
